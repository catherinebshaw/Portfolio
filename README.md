# All About Me

Welcome to a portfolio of some of my recent web development work. 

As an active participant of the U of T / Trilogy Coding Bootcamp (2021) I have been busy creating a number of programs with the new technologies I am exploring in the course. Some programs are group projects like the "Canada's Game" program which supports the creation of a local hockey league or the financial tracking program we called "Money for Nothing". Others are apps that highlight a new technolgy like JavaScript, HTML, CSS or a database like MySql. 
I look forward connecting - you can reach me at:

## About the Developer

While new to Web Development, I have many, MANY years of experience with both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations. This new turn in my career was motivated by the growing and urgent need for better on-line support for organizations of every size and industry.
