On this project, I was asked to use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. I was specifically asked to include the following attributes:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

It was also suggested that the Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries. Three different sizes for media viewing were specified: 400, 768, and 992. Each page was asked to have active links and include an About, Portfolio and Contact page. 

I used the Navbar function from Bootstrap for the main navigation. This navigation provides a top fixed bar that collapses in the small sizes < 540px. 

In the main body, I included a repeating background image for contrast. 

Content in the About and Contact pages were included in container with an absolute position.

The portfolio of images on the porfolio page was built using a  Bootstrap Grid of rows and columns. Built in two separate containers, the heading is a single row while the pictures are placed in two columns within three rows. As the screen size adjusts, the pictures will stack within the container.  

Finally, a fixed border was placed at the bottom of the page to provide an anchor. 

IMAGES

Images for the pages at their various sizes can be found in the 'assets' folder and include images of all three pages at the following widths: 400, 768 and 992. 

This project was a great introduction to bootstrap and responsive images. Considerable learning happened through research, coaching and trial and error. Thanks to Assistant Instructor Luca for the tips on navigation.
